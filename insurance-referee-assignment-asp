## Project Overview
This project models and solves an insurance referee assignment problem
using Answer Set Programming (ASP). The goal is to optimally assign
referees to insurance cases while satisfying workload, compatibility,
regional, and risk constraints.

## Problem Objectives
- Assign exactly one referee per case
- Respect referee workload limits
- Enforce type and region compatibility
- Limit damage exposure for external referees
- Optimize assignments using weighted preferences

## Constraints Implemented
- Workload capacity constraint
- Case type compatibility
- Regional eligibility
- External referee damage restriction

## Optimization Strategy
Weak constraints with priority levels:
- **@3**: Penalize external referees when internal referees are available
- **@2**: Maximize regional preference scores
- **@1**: Maximize case-type preference scores

## Technologies
- Answer Set Programming (ASP)
- Clingo solver
